        <h2>About Miru Coffee</h2>
        <p>
          At Miru Coffee, we are passionate about flavor and craftsmanship. We select only premium specialty-grade beans from trusted producers across the globe. Using our air roasting method, we unlock clean, vibrant flavors without smokiness.
        </p>
        <p>
          Every roast is crafted in small batches, typically every two weeks, and shipped within two days to ensure freshness. Our roasting style is guided by curiosity, sensory testing, and a deep respect for origin and process.
        </p>
        <p>
          Based in rural Texas, we proudly serve neighbors near and far who care about quality, transparency, and good coffee.
