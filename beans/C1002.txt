      This vibrant Guatemala profile delivers juicy acidity and layered sweetness. 
      As a roaster, we love how this washed coffee reveals both structured clarity and a floral brightness — 
      making it perfect for both pour-over and espresso roast development.

    This lot is sourced through a U.S.-based green importer who works with Cooperative La Asunción, 
    a well-established group of smallholder farmers in the Acatenango region of Guatemala. 
    The co-op's farmers typically manage plots between 1800–2000 meters above sea level, 
    growing coffee under shade trees such as Grevillea, Chalum, and Avocado.
  </p>
  <p>
    The coffee is fully washed: cherries are depulped, fermented in washing tanks with clean water for 24 hours, 
    then dried on patios for 12–15 days depending on weather. Each lot is cupped and sorted to achieve 
    consistent flavor performance.
  </p>
  <p>
    The co-op’s long-term vision has been shaped by generations of family farming. 
    Today, their coffees are part of our seasonal rotation for their clean profile and balanced sweetness.
