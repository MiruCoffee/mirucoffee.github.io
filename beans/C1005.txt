<h4>Behind the Bean</h4>
<p>The A.A.S.H. Nensebo washing station is owned and operated by the Yonis family. We have had the pleasure of sourcing coffee from Faysel Yonis for over a decade. Their friendship and commitment to quality have been a highlight in our sourcing journey.</p>

<p>Nearly 850 smallholder farmers surrounding the Werka village contribute freshly picked coffee. Each farmer typically manages 2–5 hectares of certified organic land and personally delivers their crop to the Nensebo station.</p>

<h4>Processing Method</h4>
<p>In the natural process, cherries are floated in water to remove “floaters,” then dried on raised beds. Beans are regularly rotated for even drying. Any under-ripe cherries are sorted out by hand. Drying typically takes 15–18 days depending on weather conditions.</p>

<h4>Our Impression</h4>
<p>We are truly blown away by the cup profile of this coffee. The perfect growing altitude, heirloom varietals, and attention to detail from picking to drying, all combine to produce a stunningly complex and vibrant cup.</p>
