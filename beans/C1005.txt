    This coffee is sourced through a U.S.-based green coffee importer who partners with the A.A.S.H. Nensebo washing station in Ethiopia’s West Arsi region. The station is managed by the Yonis family and serves a network of nearly 850 smallholder farmers in Werka village and surrounding areas.
  </p>
  <p>
    Most contributing farmers manage 2–5 hectares of certified organic coffee and personally deliver freshly picked cherries to the station.
    According to the importer, the coffee is naturally processed: cherries are floated in water to remove “floaters,” then dried on raised beds and rotated regularly. Any under-ripe cherries are hand-sorted. Drying takes approximately 15–18 days depending on the weather.
