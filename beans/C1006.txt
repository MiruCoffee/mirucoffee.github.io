  <p>
    The Rama Women’s Association members underwent extensive Good Agricultural Practices training with Greenco,
    establishing a model farm in 2017 and diversifying into coffee, beans, vegetables, and livestock.
    Through improved cultivation techniques and support from Bugestad—providing ISABU seedlings and organic compost—
    yields have increased from 0.7 kg to 2 kg per plant, benefiting over 120 female smallholders.

    During harvest, cherries are handpicked and delivered to Mubuga washing station for strict quality control:
    wet processing with floatation, multiple hand-sorting steps, and slow drying on raised beds for 3–4 weeks under tarps.
    After warehouse assessments by Greenco’s expert cuppers, final milling at Budeca involves meticulous hand sorting under UV light,
    ensuring only flawless beans are selected for roasting.
