      <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
      <p><em>Last updated: July 2025</em></p>

      <h2>1. Scope</h2>
      <p>These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your access to and use of the Miru Coffee website (the “Site”), including browsing, ordering, and any other services offered.</p>

      <h2>2. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
      <p>By visiting or using the Site or placing an order, you confirm that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms in their entirety. If you do not agree, please discontinue use of the Site immediately.</p>

      <h2>3. Privacy Protection</h2>
      <p>We respect your privacy. We collect, use, and store your personal data in accordance with our Privacy Policy. Please review it before providing any information.</p>

      <h2>4. Information Security</h2>
      <p>You agree to safeguard any credentials, passwords, or account information and to be responsible for all activities under your account. Notify us immediately of any unauthorized use.</p>

      <h2>5. Intellectual Property</h2>
      <p>All trademarks, text, images, audio, video, designs, software, and site layout are owned by Miru Coffee or its licensors and protected by copyright and other intellectual property laws. You may not reproduce, distribute, modify, or create derivative works without our prior written permission.</p>

      <h2>6. User Conduct &amp; Prohibited Uses</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Transmit malicious code (viruses, trojans, etc.) or use automated tools (bots, spiders) to scrape content.</li>
        <li>Interfere with the Site’s operation or overload our servers.</li>
        <li>Impersonate any person or misrepresent your affiliation.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>7. Online Purchase Conditions</h2>
      <p>By placing an order, you represent that you are at least 18 years old (or the legal age in your jurisdiction) and that the billing and shipping information you provide is accurate and complete.</p>

      <h2>8. Product Information &amp; Inventory</h2>
      <h3>Bean Announcements &amp; Availability</h3>
      <p>Our roaster selects each batch’s coffee varieties based on seasonal supply and flavor profiles, then posts those varieties on the Site. You may only purchase the roasted beans listed; you <strong>cannot</strong> choose raw bean varieties or roast levels.</p>
      <h3>Descriptions &amp; Images</h3>
      <p>Product descriptions, prices, availability, and images are for reference only. Actual stock levels and appearance may vary.</p>
      <h3>Shipping Timeline</h3>
      <p>All coffee is roasted to order and shipped within <strong>three (3) business days</strong> of roasting completion. If we cannot meet this timeline due to high demand or other factors, we will notify you by email or voicemail.</p>
      <h3>Flavor Variations &amp; Substitutions</h3>
      <p>Because each batch’s beans and roasting conditions vary, flavor may differ from previous orders. If a listed variety becomes unavailable, we will update the announced offerings on the Site and notify you. Substitutions or flavor variations do not qualify for returns or refunds.</p>
      <h3>Return &amp; Exchange Policy</h3>
      <p>Coffee beans are perishable, so we do <strong>not</strong> accept returns or exchanges after shipment. If your order arrives damaged or with a confirmed quality issue, please contact us within 24 hours with photos and a description via email or voicemail. We will arrange a replacement or refund as appropriate.</p>

      <h2>9. Payment &amp; Third-Party Processing</h2>
      <p>All payments are processed securely through <strong>QuickBooks Payments</strong> (an Intuit service). We do not store your full payment details. Your transaction is subject to QuickBooks Payments’ Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.</p>

      <h2>10. Subscription Plans (if applicable)</h2>
