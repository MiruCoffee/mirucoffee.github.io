<h1 class="hero-heading">Welcome to Miru Coffee</h1>
<p class="hero-subheading">Air-roasted specialty coffee, handcrafted in small batches from rural Texas.</p>

<p>
  At Miru Coffee, we use a <strong>modern air roaster</strong> to precisely roast 
  <strong>premium-grade beans</strong>. Our method produces a cleaner, more vibrant flavor — 
  no smokiness, just the pure expression of origin.
</p>

<p>
  We roast fresh every two weeks. You can <strong>subscribe</strong> to receive a rotating selection every 2, 4, or 6 weeks.
